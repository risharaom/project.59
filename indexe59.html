        <h1> Headlines </h1> <div class="line"> </div> <br>   <h2> U.S. airlines are pushing back against the possibility of COVID-19 testing before domestic flights after the Biden administration said it is "actively looking" at making it a requirement.

"It would have us testing Americans on airplanes that we all know are safe to be on," American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said during the carrier's Q4 earnings call.


Executives from Southwest and JetBlue echoed that sentiment, explaining that a domestic testing requirement would be too costly and pose logistical challenges. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said Wednesday that the conversation is "ongoing" and that the agency is "actively looking at it."

The domestic testing would expand upon the administration's mandatory requirement for U.S.-bound travelers, which went into effect Tuesday. All travelers flying into the U.S. must now provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test, taken no more than three days before their flight, or they will be denied boarding. In Thursday’s earnings call, American Airlines said this new requirement has hurt demand for its short-haul international flying, mainly to Mexico and other Caribbean beach destinations.

American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said his airline would work with the government should they mandate domestic testing, but expressed concerns such a requirement could disrupt already volatile demand.

"We certainly want to make sure it is something that wouldn't restrict demand," Parker said. "No one has talked to us officially about doing that -- and if they do we will do our best to make sure we stress how safe it is to fly."

Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly said in an investor call that the focus should be on the continued rollout of the vaccine and asked, "why pick on air travel?"

"We don't have adequate testing capacity for the country in the first place," Kelly said. "It's just unrealistic to expect that we can efficiently and effectively do testing on a larger scale."

JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty echoed this point in an earnings call Thursday saying, "frankly, we're concerned that it would actually reduce the ability to some people who legitimately need to get test for health reasons."</h2>

        <h2> House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is expected to meet with former President Donald Trump on Thursday at Mar-a-Lago. The top House Republican and potential future speaker of the House is visiting the twice-impeached and still-to-stand-trial former president, just eight days after he left Washington before his successor was sworn in.

Things are breaking Trump's way -- despite or even because of the turmoil inside the Republican Party. State parties and activists are lining up behind him, prospects for impeachment conviction are fading fast and President Joe Biden's executive orders and progressive priorities are making it easier for the GOP to find unified messaging. Perhaps most tellingly, intra-party fights appear riskier for those who stand against him than those who remain loyal -- at least for the moment. McCarthy visits Trump even as efforts move forward to oust the No. 3 House Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney, over her support for impeachment; McCarthy is in Florida, yet Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Trump loyalist, will be in Cheney's Wyoming on Thursday.

Republicans have a whole lot of work to do to figure out what the party needs to look like from here. But the fact that Trump is having some decent political breaks, even while mostly silent and under impeachment, says more than the tweets the former president can't send.  </h2>

    <h2> (Bloomberg) -- Robinhood Markets, the trading app that’s popular with investors behind this month’s wildest stock swings, has drawn down some of its credit lines with banks, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

The firm has tapped at least several hundred million dollars, one of the people said. The company’s lenders include JPMorgan Chase and Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Representatives for Robinhood and those banks declined to comment.

The behind-the-scenes rush to bolster Robinhood’s finances adds to signs that recent market havoc is putting a strain on the company, which has signed up throngs of retail investors for its app during the pandemic. The firm is among brokerages that clamped down on trading in shares of GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. on Thursday, setting off outrage among customers. Robinhood also told users it may close out some of their positions as it takes steps to reduce account risks.

“As a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits,” Robinhood said in a blog post Thursday. “Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment. These requirements exist to protect investors and the markets and we take our responsibilities to comply with them seriously, including through the measures we have taken today.”

Robinhood Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev said the firm drew down its credit line and restricted client buying of certain stocks to protect its financial position.

“Look, it is not negotiable for us to comply with our financial requirements and our clearinghouse deposits,” Tenev said Thursday on Bloomberg Television. “We have to do that.”

The extreme volatility “generated substantial risk” for brokerages, resulting in the need for stricter requirements on those firms, according to the Depositary Trust & Clearing Corp.

    <h2> Kobe Bryant's death in a helicopter crash on Jan. 26, 2020 is one of those moments people will always remember where they were when they heard the news.

"A lot of guys dropped to the floor and started crying," says Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr of his team's practice that day. "Nothing happened for 10 minutes. We all just sat there in silence. It was one of the worst moments of all of our lives. I don't think any of us will ever forget that day."

USA TODAY Sports is looking back at that day and the days since to mark the first anniversary. Those who knew Bryant, his daughter, Gianna, and the seven others who died are still trying to make sense of the crash, as are those who were fans of the NBA legend. </h2>
